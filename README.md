## Overview:
MIPS assembly Program Powers_of_Two will calculate and print the powers of 2 from 2^0 up to and including 2^12.

<!-- Steps -->
## Steps:
1. set a while loop which calculate power of two for each as n = 12
2. print and save power of two output in data segment
3. pirnt out 2^(t0)=(output)
4. print next line after each output
